Coding Challenge: Weather

Below are the details needed to construct an ATM/branch locator application based on a public JPMC API.

Public API
Create a free account at openweathermap.org. Just takes a few minutes. Full documentation for the service below is on their site, be sure to take a few minutes to understand it.

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Westervile,oh,us&APPID=YOUR_APP_ID

You will also need icons from here:

http://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions



Requirements

These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If there are details I have omitted, it is because I will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution.

Create a browser or native-app based application to server as a basic weather app.
Search Screen
Allow customer to enter a US city
Call the openweathermap.org API and display the information you think a user would be interested in seeing. Be sure to has the app download and display a weather icon.
Auto load the last city searched upon app launch.
In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, I'll try to prioritize what we are looking for versus what is less meaningful.
